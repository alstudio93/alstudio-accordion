If you are following along with the YouTube demonstration, please use this branch as a reference in case you get stuck along the way!

If you would like to start from the very beginning, please reference the branches made available for your convenience.

For those of you who would rather use CSS rather than Tailwind, please reference the branch labeled Vanilla-CSS. Please Note that it *IS NOT* a starter branch.
